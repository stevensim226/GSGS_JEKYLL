This page is about building a GitHub Page with no [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/).
It is assumed that you know and have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, and know how to setup
a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/).

## Using your own domain name (eg. doit.vlsm.org)

You might want to set your own domain.

<br>

<br>
See also <https://doit.vlsm.org>.
Your domain name is stored in "CNAME" file.
Let's check the alias setting:

### INPUT
```
cat CNAME 

```

### OUTPUT
```
$ cat CNAME 
doit.vlsm.org
$ 
```

<br>
You have to set your DNS too. 
In this example, "doit.vlsm.org" is set as an alias (CNAME) of "thisishowmedoit.github.io".
Let's check the DNS setting:

### INPUT
```
host doit.vlsm.org

```

### OUTPUT
```
$ host doit.vlsm.org
doit.vlsm.org is an alias for thisishowmedoit.github.io.
thisishowmedoit.github.io has address 185.199.111.153
thisishowmedoit.github.io has address 185.199.109.153
thisishowmedoit.github.io has address 185.199.110.153
thisishowmedoit.github.io has address 185.199.108.153
$ 
```
